Iraq clears visit by Ohio official
By Scott Montgomery Washington
The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. Rep. Tony Hall visit the
Iraq clears visit by Ohio officialcountry next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered
since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday.
The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including
Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals
and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective
in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems.
Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some
say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation
of the bombing campaign.
The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical
infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization.
In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of
``semi starvation.''
Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since
the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep.
Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in
diplomatic trouble.
Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the night
before driving to Iraq. Flights are not permitted into Iraq. Hall is to
return to Washington on April 22.

Charlie you look quite down
With your big fat eyes
And your big fat frown
The world doesn't have to be so gray
Charlie when your life's a mess
When your feeling blue
Or are in distress
I know what can wash that sad away
All you have to do is
Put a banana in your ear (a banana in my ear?)
Put a ripe banana right into your favorite ear
It's true (says who?)
So true
Once it's in your gloom will disappear
The bad in the world is hard to hear
When in your ear a banana cheers
So go and put a banana in your ear
Put a banana in your ear (I'd rather keep my ear clear)
You will never be happy
If you live your life in fear
It's true! (says you)
So true!
When it's in the skies are bright and clear
Oh, every day of every year
The sun shines bright in this big blue sphere
So go and put a banana in your
Earrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

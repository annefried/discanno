## Commit format:
````
    DA-GH_ISSUE: Message.
    
    The message describes what the patch changes in single sentence and imperative.
    Imagine if you are having a new bug and scroll through the log history and
    some commits say 'backup' and 'some changes'. This doesn't help you to understand
    what was changed and how did somebody change that. Additionally you don't
    want to scroll through 5 commits for one small feature.
````

So the first line is a real life imperative statement with DA for 'DiscAnno' and a GitHub issue #. The body describes the behavior without the patch, why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.
    
This should be one single commit. If you committed in the meantime and want to squash your commits, do this:
````
    git commit --soft RESET~<Num> && git commit -m "DA-#GH_ISSUE: ..."
````
'Num' determines the number of commits you want to squash. !Be careful! and don't squash merges!

Create for every ticket a branch and rebase your branch with the current master from the repository so that there are no merge conflicts when merging the branch with the master. Name your branch after the same naming convention like commits "DA-GH_ISSUE". The best practice is to pull the current master while being on the master branch and do the following:
````
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout -b DA-GH_ISSUE
````
Then you have the current master state, created a new branch after the naming convention and checked it out.
